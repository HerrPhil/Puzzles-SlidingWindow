Hello Sliding Window Solution

for right index 0

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 0, or right (0) - left (0) + 1 = 1

for right index 1

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 1, or right (1) - left (0) + 1 = 2

for right index 2

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 2, or right (2) - left (0) + 1 = 3

for right index 3

the input at right index is zero

increment numOfZeros to 1

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 3, or right (3) - left (0) + 1 = 4

for right index 4

the input at right index is zero

increment numOfZeros to 2

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 4, or right (4) - left (0) + 1 = 5

for right index 5

the input at right index is zero

increment numOfZeros to 3

while the numOfZeros = 3 is greater than k = 2

left index 0

increment left index to 1

while the numOfZeros = 3 is greater than k = 2

left index 1

increment left index to 2

while the numOfZeros = 3 is greater than k = 2

left index 2

increment left index to 3

while the numOfZeros = 3 is greater than k = 2

left index 3

the input at left index is zero

decrement numOfZeros to 2

increment left index to 4

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 5, or right (5) - left (4) + 1 = 2

for right index 6

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 5, or right (6) - left (4) + 1 = 3

for right index 7

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 5, or right (7) - left (4) + 1 = 4

for right index 8

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 5, or right (8) - left (4) + 1 = 5

for right index 9

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 5, or right (9) - left (4) + 1 = 6

for right index 10

the input at right index is zero

increment numOfZeros to 3

while the numOfZeros = 3 is greater than k = 2

left index 4

the input at left index is zero

decrement numOfZeros to 2

increment left index to 5

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 6, or right (10) - left (5) + 1 = 6

the maximum number of consecutive 1's when at most 2 0's can be flipped is 6
