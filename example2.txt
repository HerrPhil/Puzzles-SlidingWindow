for right index 0

the input at right index is zero

increment numOfZeros to 1

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 0, or right (0) - left (0) + 1 = 1

for right index 1

the input at right index is zero

increment numOfZeros to 2

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 1, or right (1) - left (0) + 1 = 2

for right index 2

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 2, or right (2) - left (0) + 1 = 3

for right index 3

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 3, or right (3) - left (0) + 1 = 4

for right index 4

the input at right index is zero

increment numOfZeros to 3

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 4, or right (4) - left (0) + 1 = 5

for right index 5

the input at right index is zero

increment numOfZeros to 4

while the numOfZeros = 4 is greater than k = 3

left index 0

the input at left index is zero

decrement numOfZeros to 3

increment left index to 1

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 5, or right (5) - left (1) + 1 = 5

for right index 6

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 5, or right (6) - left (1) + 1 = 6

for right index 7

for right index 8

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 7, or right (8) - left (1) + 1 = 8

for right index 9

the input at right index is zero

increment numOfZeros to 4

while the numOfZeros = 4 is greater than k = 3

left index 1

the input at left index is zero

decrement numOfZeros to 3

increment left index to 2

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 8, or right (9) - left (2) + 1 = 8

while the numOfZeros = 4 is greater than k = 3

left index 5

the input at left index is zero

decrement numOfZeros to 3

increment left index to 6

the maximum number of consecutive 1's is maxxx = 10, or right (13) - left (6) + 1 = 8

for right index 14

the input at right index is zero

increment numOfZeros to 4

while the numOfZeros = 4 is greater than k = 3
